# 📌 VECTOR STORE (SCRATCH IMPLEMENTATION)

A **vector store** (or vector database) is a special kind of database designed to store and manage **vector embeddings**—numerical representations of data like text, images, or audio—so they can be efficiently searched, compared, or retrieved using similarity measures (like **cosine similarity**).

---
## 🗃️ **What is a Vector Store?**
A vector store is a system that:

✅ Stores **vectors** (usually high-dimensional, like 384D, 768D, 1536D)

✅ Indexes them efficiently using data structures like **HNSW** or **FAISS**

✅ Allows **similarity search** (e.g., find the most similar documents/images to a query vector)

✅ Often stores **metadata** (like IDs, timestamps, text chunks, etc.) alongside each vector

🚀 Why not use normal databases? Because they can't do fast similarity search in **high dimensions**. Comparing millions of vectors one by one is too slow!

## 🛠️ **Popular Vector Stores**
- **FAISS** (by Facebook) – local, fast, open-source
- **Pinecone** – cloud-native vector DB
- **Weaviate** – open-source with hybrid search (text + vector)
- **Chroma** – popular with LangChain
- **Milvus** – scalable and open-source
- **Qdrant** – Rust-based vector DB with strong performance

## ⚙️ **Steps to Implement a Vector Store (from Scratch)**

### 1️⃣ **Uses Python**
The implementation is in Python for easy prototyping and efficiency.

### 2️⃣ **In-Memory Data Structure**
An "in-memory data structure" means storing vectors in **RAM** instead of a disk, providing much faster access and processing speeds.

### 3️⃣ **Storage Format**
We use a **custom data structure** using a dictionary (`dict`) for fast lookups.

### 4️⃣ **Indexing**
Indexing is done using **hash maps** and **adjacency lists** to speed up retrieval.

### 5️⃣ **Updating Vectors**
Operations like **adding** and **deleting** vectors are implemented efficiently.

### 6️⃣ **Memory Management**
Efficient memory usage is ensured to handle large-scale vector storage.

### 7️⃣ **Serialization & Persistence**
- **Serialization**: Converts data into a **storable format** (like JSON or binary) to save on disk.
- **Persistence**: Ensures vector data is **not lost** when the program stops.

---
## 🔥 **Implementation of the Vector Store Class**
The vector store consists of **two dictionaries** to store the data:
- `vector_data`: Stores the actual vector embeddings.
- `vector_index`: Stores the similarity-based adjacency list for fast retrieval.

### **Vector IDs**
Vector IDs are either **manually assigned** or generated using a **complex algorithm**.

---

---
## 🎯 **Function Breakdown**

### **1️⃣ `add_vector()`**
- Adds the vector to `vector_data`.
- Updates `vector_index` by computing similarities with existing vectors.

### **2️⃣ `update_index()`**
- Loops over all stored vectors.
- Computes **cosine similarity** between new and existing vectors.
- Stores an **adjacency list** in `vector_index`.

### **3️⃣ `get_vector()`**
- Retrieves the vector for a given ID.

### **4️⃣ `find_similar_vectors()`**
- Computes cosine similarity between the query vector and stored vectors.
- Returns the **top N most similar vectors**.

---
## 🚀 **Example Usage**
```python
# Create a vector store
store = VectorStore()

# Add some vectors
store.add_vector("vec1", [1, 2, 3])
store.add_vector("vec2", [4, 5, 6])
store.add_vector("vec3", [1, 0, 0])

# Retrieve a vector
print(store.get_vector("vec1"))  # Output: [1 2 3]

# Find similar vectors to a query
query_vector = [1, 1, 1]
similar_vectors = store.find_similar_vectors(query_vector, top_n=2)
print(similar_vectors)
```

---
## 🎯 **Why This Implementation Matters?**
✅ **Efficient similarity search** using cosine similarity.

✅ **Scalable indexing** for fast lookups.

✅ **In-memory storage** for quick access.

✅ **Customizable & lightweight** compared to full-fledged vector databases.

## 🎯 **Next Steps & Enhancements**
🔹 Implement **HNSW indexing** for faster searches 🚀

🔹 Support **disk-based persistence** instead of just in-memory storage 🗃️

🔹 Use **clustering techniques** like K-Means to improve performance 📊
